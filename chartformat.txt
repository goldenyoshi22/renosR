The Non-Raw Format p0.1

metadata - this is specific to lines so don't put title as the third line or something like that


title = song123 
//sets the title of the chart to "song123"

subtitle = yeah357
//sets the subtitle of the chart to "yeah357"

audio = song123.wav
//sets the audio that plays in the chart to "song123.wav"

difficulty = 0 3 6 8 11 0
//sets the difficulty number of beginner to 0, easy to 3, medium to 6, hard to 8, insane to 11, and nightmare to 0
//basically, corresponds to difficulty numbers respectively [beginner, easy, medium, hard, insane, nightmare]

preview = 53.100
//sets where the song will preview play in the menu to 0:53.100

volume = 80
//sets the volume of the song to 80%

bpm = 123
//sets the base bpm of the chart to 123

offset = -0.078
//makes the song play its audio 0.078 seconds earlier
//negative is earlier, and positive is later

-----------------------------------------------------
the chart

commands:
>start //starts the chart
>end //ends the chart
>bpm [num] //sets the bpm to [num] in the middle of the song
>difficulty [num] //use before starting the chart, sets the difficulty it's writing on respectively [starts at 0 for beginner and ends at 5 for nightmare]
>text [sample] //shows text reading [sample] at the middle-bottom of the screen

1-6 for notes
P to change it to purple
C to change it back to red/blue
there should be a space between notes but if you don't have one it can do multiple things at once


example:

song123
by yeah357
[on Insane 11 and there is also a Medium 6 that has no chart for some reason]

[ ][ ][x][ ][ ][ ] - text at the middle-bottom saying "hi :P"
[x][ ][ ][x][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][x][x] - purple mode on
[ ][x][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[x][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

is

title = song123
subtitle = yeah357
audio = song123.wav
difficulty = 0 0 6 0 11 0
preview = 53.100
volume = 80
bpm = 123
offset = -0.078

>difficulty 4
>start
1 2 P56 14
>text hi :P
3
>end







renos raw chart format
basically it's a huge array so surround everything in []
so seperate all notes by commas like [1, 2, 3]

1-6 for notes
"purple" to change it to purple mode
"notpurple" to make it not purple anymore
["text", "sample"] to make it show text saying what you put in the sample at the middle-bottom
put stuff in another [] to do multiple things at once



example:

[ ][ ][x][ ][ ][ ] - text at the middle-bottom saying "hi :P"
[x][ ][ ][x][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][x][x] - purple mode on
[ ][x][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[x][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

=

[1, 2, ["purple", 1, 2], [1, 5, 6], [["text", "hi :P"], 4]]
